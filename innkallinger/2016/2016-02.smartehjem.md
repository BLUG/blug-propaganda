with the topic

## Home Automation

with Kostiantyn Denysenko

For most people smart house starts with one light switch that can be controlled 
with a phone. Some may leave it at that, some may go further and have more 
lights. I believe that we can go even further and teach houses to predict what 
environmental we would like to be in at the moment or how to achieve it. 
Even more, let’s have that ability with us all the time. Let’s make a system 
where all connected devices can be used to make you feel at home away from 
home. Welcome to a new world – the world of SmartHome!

Kostiantyn Denysenko is an Electronics engineer. Works for Sensario. Designs 
hardware for wireless sensor networks

Presentation will be held in english, questions can be made in either 
english or norwegian.

NB: The meeting will be held in UROM at the library. Not Auditoriet, which 
is our usual meeting spot.


## Practical notes:

The library closes at 8 pm. Our meeting slot is moved from 7pm to 6:30 pm

We move on to Henrik after the talk for some smalltalk and refreshments.
